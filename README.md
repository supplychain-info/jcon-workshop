# LLM Powered App with Jakarta EE, MicroProfile, and LangChain4j

This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a Jakarta EE and MicroProfile-based application, utilizing LangChain4j for seamless integration. Originally inspired and adapted from [LangChain4j examples](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples), this repository has been extended to serve as a workshop for deploying and running the application in a local environment

## Overview

The application demonstrates how to build, secure, and deploy an LLM-powered application using Jakarta EE, MicroProfile, and LangChain4j.

### What You Will Learn

- Setting up your local development environment for Jakarta EE and MicroProfile.
- Integrating LangChain4j for leveraging Large Language Models in your application.
- Containerizing your application with Docker (or Podman).
- Implementing security best practices for your application.
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- JDK 17 or later
